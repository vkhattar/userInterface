    <h1>CS349 Assignment 4</h1>
    <strong><em>Due: Friday, April 3, 2015, 5PM EST</em></strong>

    <div>
        <h2>Assignment Goals</h2>

        <p>
            The goals of this assignment are to give you an opportunity to implement a front-end web application that communicates with a web framework (using classic web requests and AJAX calls) that can store and retrieve data to/from a database.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

        <p>
            In this assignment, you will create a web application called
            <em>Wassup</em>, which allows users to send a "sup?" message to their friends.  "sup?" is short-hand for "what's up?", which is an common alternative way to say "hello!"
        </p>

        <p>
            Specifically, users should be able to
            <ul>
                <li>log in and log out of the application</li>
                <li>add/remove friends to/from the contact list</li>
                <li>view a list of the friends in their contact list</li>
                <li>select 1 or more friends in the contact list, and send a "sup?" message to them</li>
                <li>view "sup?" messages from friends</li>
                <li>clear a particular "sup?" message from the deck</li>
                <li>switch between a private versus public server</li>
            </ul>


    </div>


    <div>
        <h2>
            Implementation Requirements
        </h2>

        <h4>User Interface</h4>
        The wireframe for this application is shown here:
        <img src="assignment_spec_images/mockup.png" class="img-responsive">
        </p>

        <h4>Login / Logout</h4>

        <p>We assume the user ID is set in a cookie. If it is not set, users will be redirected to a login page (views/wassup_login.html).  The login functionality is provided and is fully functional.  However, you should provide additional styling of the login page such that it is consistent with the look of your application.  The logout function is provided in the server.  You need to implement a logout link/button in the user interace, which will issue a form POST to the server to handle logout.
        </p>

        <h4>Contact List</h4>
        <p>The contact list should display a list of friends a user has.  The user should be able to add a new friend (using a unique alias) or remove a friend from the contact list.
        </p>

        <h4>Sending and Receiving "Sup?" Messages</h4>
        <p>
        The "sup?" message should be drawn on the HTML canvas by randomly manipulating the graphic context before calling fillText() on the HTML canvas.  That is, each time the user receives a "sup?" message from a friend, that message should have a different look, color and size from the previous message.
        </p>

        <p>
        The system should periodically poll the server to check if there are "sup?" messages.   The "sup?" messages should be displayed one at a time, with the most recent message displayed first.  Each "Sup?" message should be accompanied by information about who sent it and at what time. Users should be able to click on a "next" and "previous" button to see the next or previous "sup?" message.
        </p>

        <p>The frontend implementation will involve modifications to the following files:
            <ul>
                <li>views/wassup_app.html</li>
                <li>views/wassup_login.html</li>
                <li>static/css/wassup.css</li>
                <li>static/js/wassup.js</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Switching between Private and Public Server</h4>
         There are two server locations -- the public server is at http://104.197.3.113, the private  server is at http://localhost, i.e., on your own machine.  The public server is accessible by all CS349 students, and so you can use the server to send/receive "sup?" messages to/from your classmates, as long as you know their user ID.

         Your application needs to provide a way for users to switch between using the private and public server.   The ability to switch to a private (i.e., local) server is useful when the public server is down or if the response is slow.  Your application needs to be able to deal gracefully with errors and latency issues.  When appropriate, you should also incorporate into the user interface components (e.g., progress bar, busy indicators) to help the application maintain responsiveness, by providing feedback to the users about the status/progress of their requests.

        <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
        <p> Your frontend designs need to be <b>responsive</b> and display well both on the desktop and mobile devices.  When the width is <= 450, the application should switch to mobile mode.  In the mobile mode, the layout should change to fit the smaller screen size, which may require resizing some of the user interface components and disabling some of the functionalities.  Below is a screenshot of an example of a mobile version of the "Wassup!" application.</p>
        <img src="assignment_spec_images/responsive.png" class="img-responsive">


        <h4>Client-Server Communication</h4>
        <p>
            The backend server (wassup.py) is written using a web framework called Python-Bottle (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html).  You should use the provided backend system as is, without having to make any modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            To run the backend server <i>privately</i> on your local machine, type "python wassup.py" in the terminal, then go to "http://localhost:8080" using a web browser.  You can run print_db.py to print out the content of the database.  This is maybe useful for debugging purposes.   Alternatively, your application can communicate with the public server directly at http://104.197.3.113.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each "sup?" message has a unique sup_id.  This ID is used to uniquely identify each "sup?" message so that users can clear a particular "sup?" message from their deck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your application can call the backend with the following commands and associated data:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>create_user</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input: user_id, full_name</li>
                        <li>output: a string (upon the successful execution of the command)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>add_friend</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input: user_id</li>
                        <li>output: a string (upon the successful execution of the command)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>remove_friend</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input: user_id</li>
                        <li>output: a string (upon the successful execution of the command)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>get_friends</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input: user_id</li>
                        <li>output: a list of key-value pairs listing the user_id and full_name of each friend.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>send_sup</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input: user_id, sup_id, date</li>
                        <li>output: a string (upon the successful execution of the command)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>remove_sup</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input: sup_id</li>
                        <li>output: a string (upon the successful execution of the command)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>clear_sups</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input: sup_id</li>
                        <li>output: a string (upon the successful execution of the command)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Some sample code for making an AJAX call to the server is provided in static/js/wassup.js.  Essentially, to issue a request to the server, you need to pass in a JSON object inside the handleAjaxRequest() method with the following properties (all required):
            <ul>
                <li><b>protocol_version</b>: A number indicating the version of the server implementation.  It is in general good practice to include the protocol version number in case the server implementation changes.  For the purpose of this assignment, you can send "1.0" as the protocol version number.</li>
                <li><b>message_id</b>: The ID of the message being sent.  This is an unique identifier generated by the client to distinguish one message from another.</li>
                <li><b>command</b>: The actual command to execute (as shown above)</li>
                <li><b>command_data</b>: Command-specific data (as shown above, null if there is none)</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
            In response to the request, the server will return a JSON object with the following key-value pairs (all fields will be present in every response):
            <ul>
                <li><b>protocol_version</b>: The protocol version the server is using</li>
                <li><b>error</b>: string representing the error encountered, or empty string if no error</li>
                <li><b>command</b>: The command this object is a response to</li>
                <li><b>message_id</b>: The ID of the original request/message</li>
                <li><b>reply_data</b>: The return data for executing the command. Undefined if an error. The type
               of data returned is command-specific.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            Testing
        </h2>
        <p>
            No unit testing is required for this assignment.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Implementation Constraints</h2>
        <p>
            You must complete the assignment within the following constraints:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>You must use only HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Python, and the included JavaScript and CSS files.
            <em>You may not use any other web frameworks, or third-party JavaScript, CSS or Python files for this assignment</em>, except for <b>underscore.js</b> and <b>bootstrap (js and css)</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The wireframe designs are meant to be a suggestion for how the interface and interaction could be
            supported. You have latitude to change how users provide input to the system, but it must be
            <em>at least</em> as usable as the design we provide. You will also need to improve the visual design
            beyond the sparse wireframe designs provided.
        </li>
        <li>
            All of your JavaScript files should work with (and include) <code>'use strict';</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may use <em>code snippets</em> from third-party sources, but not entire solutions. For example,
            your graphing code <em>must be your own</em>. You must cite the use of any third-party code (including
            a URL if the example was obtained online).
        </li>
        <li>
            Your assignment may not make use of any external files loaded over the Internet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Server Etiquette</b>: Any friend you add to the public server will be visible to anyone else.  You should not post any content to the public server that would be deemed offensive or against university regulations or the law.   We will be logging each access to the public server.
        </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Marking</h2>
        <p>
            To receive a great mark, you must implement the system as described above, under the given constraints,
            with all unit tests passing, while having an aesthetically pleasing design and a great user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a <em>rough</em> guide, <em>about 25%</em> of your mark will be allocated to the visual design and user experience,
            with the rest allocated to implementation concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            TAs will mark your assignment using the latest version of Chrome on whatever platform
            they use on a daily basis. In theory, the specific platform shouldn't matter. If we
            find platform differences, we'll handle them as they arise. They will mark the assignment
            in "offline" mode (i.e., with no access to the Internet).
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>How to Submit</h2>
        You will use subversion to both check out and submit your assignment. Details can be found on the
        <a href="https://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS349/w15/about.html#svn">course website</a>.
